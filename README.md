# jsfour-idcard

### Important!!! The script was not written by me, I just added new designs and changed the code a bit. The script itself belongs to [jsfour](https://forum.cfx.re/u/jsfour/summary)

### Original Script: https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-jsfour-idcard-esx/169787

# What is new?
- the line for the signature was extended
- a police badge was added
- new color design
- all texts are now optimally adapted

# New Cards
